<p><em>The tabulator is one possible form of a data browser. It is only one
way of looking at the Semantic Web, just as a refrigerator is just
one way of using electricity.</em></p>
<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>We make some effort to stick to the ECMAScript and Dom specs
where they apply, but we develop and test on <b>Firefox</b>,
and some Firefox-specific dependencies may have crept in.</p>

<p>To view sites
outside of the local domain in Firefox, you must <a href=
"#Security">change your FireFox settings</a>.</p>

<p>Compatibility with other browsers is something we'd like help
with. For example, David Håsäther contributed a <a
href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/5053">opera widget</a>.  (See
also <a
href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/issues/tabulator/issue119">issue 199,
Opera compatibility</a>).</p>

<p><b>Safari:</b> Weird bugs occur all over the place. "Undefined"
is littered all over the screen.</p>
<p><b>Internet Explorer:</b> Not functional in Internet Explorer.
We are interested in help on this.</p>
<h2><a name="Security" id="Security">Security and browsing
different sites</a></h2>
<h3>The Cross-Domain Browsing Problem</h3>
<p>Firefox security won't in general let a script from a given DNS
domain (like www.w3.org) read web data from a different domain.
Therefore, if you try to browse an rdf file from a different
domain, the tabulator will fail. There are two ways to allow
cross-domain requests.</p>
<h3>The Simple Solution</h3>
<ol>
<li>Type into the main browser URI bar "about:config" and hit
return to get to the config page.</li>
<li>Type <em>codebase</em> into the filter window</li>
<li style="list-style: none">Double-click the line<br />
<tt>signed.applets.codebase_principal_support ... user set ...
boolean .. false</tt><br />
<br />
to change it to 'true'.</li>
<li>Go back to the tabulator, and try again. When the browser asks
you whether to allow the script to access arbitrary web pages,
agree. You probably want to check the "remember the answer this
question" box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that this is reducing the security of your browser. You end
up allowing any web page on the site to read data from the web,
which could include data from inside your firewall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you might also want to filter for <em>script</em> and
set the value of <em>dom.max_script_run_time</em> to more than te
default, say 30. This is the time in second it will wait before
asking you wheter you want to abort a long-running script.</p>
<h3>An Alternative Solution</h3>
<p><strong>Quit Firefox</strong> and then find your prefs.js file
and add to the bottom of it the line</p>
<pre>
user_pref("signed.applets.codebase_principal_support", true);
</pre>
<p>On Mac OS-X the file will be in somewhere like
/Users/timbl/Library/Application
Support/Firefox/Profiles/mxotp788.default, and in Windows in an
equivalent place. Then, run Firefox and the tabulator again, and
answer the dialog box as above.)</p>
<h3>Why this problem?</h3>
<p>The tabulator program is acting as your agent as you browse
data, but the Firefox program doesn't know that you can trust it.
It could be just a script on some webpage you are browsing, and it
could be trying to get information which only you have access to
and send it to a third party. It turns out that it is really
difficult to stop such a script sending messages out in some form,
so Firefox security prevents it from accessing anything on the web
to which you have access to, unless it on the same DNS domain as
the script itself. This is not a very good system, as many web
sites which do not trust each other share a domain name. But that
is how it is. A better way is for the scripts to be signed, but I
haven't got the script signing system working yet.</p>
<p>See also Mozilla/Firefox documentation on See also <a href=
"http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html#prefs">Customizing</a>
and <a href=

Signed scripts</a>.</p>
<h3>"Script is taking a long time" alerts</h3>
<p>While you are adjusting the <a href="about:config">Firefox
parameters</a>, you may wish to increase the
<strong>dom.max_script_run_time value</strong> in about:config. The
default seems to be 5 (whcih seems to give in practice around 10
secs) of time in between Firefox asking whether it is Ok whether
the script is still running. This happens when loading large RDF
files. Try 30 or adjust to taste.</p>
<h2><a name="usage" id="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<div id="key">Key: <img src="icons/clean/icon_expand.png" alt=
"expand" /> expand, <img src="icons/clean/icon_collapse.png" alt=
"collapse" /> collapse, <img src="icons/16dot-blue.gif" alt=
"fetch" /> Click the dot to fetch data. <img src=
"icons/16dot-yellow.gif" alt="requested" />loading.... <img src=
"icons/16dot-red.gif" alt="failed" />Failed to fetch data.
<img src="icons/16dot-green.gif" alt="loaded" /> Data loaded
OK.</div>
<p>The outliner window allows you to explore the semantic web in a
tree structure. The outliner begins with several initial rdf nodes
(the objects with clickable <img src="icons/clean/icon_expand.png"
alt="expand" /> symbols), and you can add more by around between
different objects by adding their URI at the top of the window and
clicking "Add to outliner". To explore an rdf node, simply expand
it by clicking the <img src="icons/clean/icon_expand.png" alt=
"expand" /> icon for that node. You can click it again to collapse
it.</p>
<p>The colored dot next to a given node indicates the status of
retrieval for that URI. See the key above. Once a data source is
retrieved, it will not need to be retrieved again, and the colored
dot will not appear in future copies of that node. A list of data
sources, accessible and not, is kept at the bottom of the
browser.</p>
<h3>Re-focusing</h3>
<p>Once you begin browsing, the nested tables quickly get quite
deep. You can clean it all up, refocussing on one item by
<strong>shift-clicking</strong> on its <img src=
"icons/clean/icon_expand.png" alt="expand" /> expand or <img src=
"icons/clean/icon_collapse.png" alt="collapse" /> collapse icon.
This removes the nested tables, and places your selected node into
the tabulator as a starting node.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you would like to refocus on a node
<i>without</i> removing the original tree you were browsing in, you
can double-click on a node field (the text next to a <img src=
"icons/clean/icon_expand.png" alt="expand" />/ <img src=
"icons/clean/icon_collapse.png" alt="collapse" /> icon).</p>
<h3>Seeing the URI</h3>
<p>The point a browser is to give you the data without the URIs
used as identifiers. They are hidden whenever there is a label,
title, or name of some sort which can be used for something on the
screen.</p>
<p>To see something's URI, click once on a table cell and (if
appropriate) the URI of the thing described in the cell will be put
in the URI bar at the top.</p>
<h3>Performing Queries on Data</h3>
<p>As you explore the outliner, you may want to create a table,
map, calendar, or other view containing certain pieces of
information about each of several equivalently-related objects.
This is how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>First find one instance of the property you are looking for and
select it by clicking on the field name (not the field value). To
select or deselect multiple field names, hold down the
<strong>Alt</strong> key.</li>
<li>The little checkboxes that appear in the selected fields and
their descendants can be checked to make a section of the query
<strong>optional</strong>. If part of a query is optional, then any
results that have no value for that field will still be shown as a
result, but with a "." in place of its value</li>
<li>Click on the button "View and Save Query"</li>
<li>You should see a table with your data appear. Be patient, this
may take up to several minutes. Once the table appears, you can
re-focus on any of the blue (non-literal) results in the table by
double-clicking on them. You can also save the table as an HTML
document with the button "Export as HTML"</li>
<li>If your query can be mapped or calendarized, click on the map
or calendar tabs to see the data in that format.</li>
<li>If you want to manually edit your query in the SPARQL query
language, click on the SPARQL tab. This tab will also allow you to
create a URL that will open the tabulator with this query already
saved in it.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, to make a table of the names of all the W3C working
group chairs and team contacts, expand World Wide Web Consortium
-&gt; W3C Groups and Organizational Structure -&gt; working group.
Now, you may want to shift-click the "working group" icon to
refocus it. We refocus on "working group" so that only matches
within "working group" will be tabulated. Open up one of the
working groups and click on the "chair" name field. Now alt click
on the "team contact" field. Both these fields should now be
highlighted in green. Now you can go down to the bottom of the
outline and click "Find All" to create the
table.</p>
<p>What you will notice in this example is that every combination
of working group/chair/team contact has its own entry in the table.
You can sort the table by clicking on the column heading of the
column to sort by. Then you can export this data as an HTML table
by clicking the "Export as HTML" button and saving the page that
appears.</p>

<h3><a name="Tutorials" id="Tutorials">Linking to a tabulator
view</a></h3>
<p>If you take the URI of the tabulator page, and then append
<tt>uri=</tt> and the <em>uri-encoded</em> URI of the thing you are
viewing, then this is a URI of a tabulator view for that thing. You
can get the URI for anything in the tabulator outline view by
clicking on it, and then looking in the tabulator's URI form field
(not the browser's address bar). Remmeber to encode # as %23.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This is a very simple unoptimized javascript implementation, so
it will tend to be slow with large files. If you get a message that
a script is taking a long time, you have a choice of letting it run
or aborting it. This is a firefox feature, you can control it using
the about:config page. (Type about:config into the firefox URL bar,
presss return, type "script" into the filter and then change the
value for dom_max_script_run_time to say 30)</p>
<p>This is a proof of concept program, many user interface things
are missing, for example from the table view.</p>
