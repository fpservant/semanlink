<h1>About the Tabulator</h1>

<br>

<p>This is one possible form of a semantic web browser.</p>

<p>It works on Firefox and Camino, may be bugs on other platforms.
&nbsp;No
no-portable features were knowingly used.&nbsp; Patches for other
platforms are welcome.</p>

<h3>Motivations</h3>

<ul>

  <li>To make RDF access easy on a platform which is open to
everyone with a website (or, hopefully, a computer) program in.</li>

  <li>To demonstrate the use of Web architecture and Semantic web
architecture as they should be used</li>

  <li>To throw up problems with the above, for experience for the
W3C TAG</li>

  <li>To find problems in general implementations or usage which
need to be corrected or brought out in best practices documents</li>

  <li>To find and design new breadcrumb protocols, conventions by
which pointers are left and followed in the Semantic Web so as to make
classes of problem solvable.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Ethos</h2>

<p>The browser browses things, not documents. Of course some
thing are
documents, but the browser considers them first as things, and then as
documents.</p>

<p>Other browsers have tended to focus on a document at a time,
or work by
amassing a large static database of RDF from all known sources and then
browsing it.</p>

<p>This browser works in a web of documents. This is partly in
order to
scale: to operate in an unbounded space without having to manage with
more
than a certain finite memory. It is partly in order to develop the
links we
need in this space.</p>

<p>When Google came to the web, it seemed to make the links less
necessary,
because one could ask Google instead of tracing the links to find
something.
Tracing the links, that is, through remembered pages, relevant pages,
trusted
pages, using one's instinct and the indications left by authors to find
the
goal. However, the links are still important. In fact, Google requires
the
links to work at all. And not just any old links: links patiently and
carefully made by thoughtful authors, automated or most often human,
for the
benefit of inquiring readers.</p>

<p>Now we are making the semantic web, and we have the Google
experience, and
we tend to start by making a huge index: we are tempted to start with
the
Google index and ignore the links. But we are missing the links. Apart
from
the FOAF world, much semantic web data is isolated from other webs of
data,
even though connections could be made. We need to make the links across
systems. This browser is designed to use these links, and hence
encourage
their creation.</p>

<p>Documents have content which describe things. They are in the
browser a
special sort of object. </p>

<p>The use of a URI to denote something is an invitation to look
it up. This
is the hypertext link in the Semantic Web. If the URI we use to identify
something is formed from adding a hash and a local identifier to the
URI of a
document, then the reference is to the thing in the document with that
local
identifier. This is the simplest&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">breadcrumbs</span>
protocol.</p>

<h4>Breadcrumbs protocols</h4>

<p>A breadcrumbs protocol is convention by which information is
left to
allow another to follow. &nbsp;When the information provider
follows
the convention on the breadcrumbs to leave, and an information seeker
follows the convention on what links to follow, then the protocol that
the seeker will be able to solve certain sorts of problem. </p>

<p> There are other forms, such as the FOAF link. The FOAF link
is a
breadcrumbs protocol as follows. Document <span style="font-family: monospace;">?d1</span> makes a
reference the thing
identified as <span style="font-family: monospace;">?x</span>
in document <span style="font-family: monospace;">?d2</span>
when:</p>

<pre> ?d1 log:says { ?y foaf:sha1sum ?s. ?y rdfs:seeAlso ?d2}.<br> ?d2 log:says { ?x foaf:mbox_sha1sum ?s }.</pre>

<p>or the same with foaf:mbox (email address)&nbsp; instead
of
foaf:mbox_sha1sum (cryptographic hash of &nbsp;email address).
&nbsp;If
the information provider of <span style="font-family: monospace;">?d1</span>
leaves that information. The seeker, having read d1, and wanting
information about ?y (1) looks up the document found under rdfs:seeAlso,
and (2) finds in d2 reference to something which has the same
foaf:mbox_sh1sum value, and infers that it is the same thing.
&nbsp;The
protocol assumes that only one person (or entity) has a given email
address, and hence checksum of email address.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This is clearly more complicated than the simple link!
&nbsp;The
tabular can do both. &nbsp; Links which could be followed are
represented by blue dots. &nbsp;The smushing by mailbox is handled
when
the properties are declared as owl:InverseFunctionalProperty.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Exploring a web of data in outline mode</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Many RDF visualizers have represented the data as
circle-and-arrow
diagrams. &nbsp;This gives you a feel for how a small number of
things
connect. &nbsp;It allows you to see clustering when a large number
of
things are related by the same properties, such as in Foafnaut or
How/Why diagrams we have made at W3C. Circles and arrows are very
intuitive and useful when trying to understand something. However, it
isn't a way to look at data with many nodes and many different
properties. It isn't used in applications we think of as handling
data, such as personal financial management, music management, calendar
management programs, for example. &nbsp;In these cases one uses
tables
or matrices. These are the densest way of comparing objects of the same
class (strictly, which are likely to share common properties).
&nbsp;mSpace &nbsp;is an example of a table-based semantic web
browser.
These table-based systems, though, tend to operate on a given set of
data, and don't naturally allow browsing.</p>

<p>Outline mode is extremely common and clearly natural for
tree-oriented data. People are typically very comfortable in a
tree-like environment. In fact, much data in the world has been
organized into trees, and the web is composed of overlapping trees with
local roots all over the place. &nbsp;This suggests that in fact a
tree-oriented browser will feel natural even though the world is
actually a web. In early hypertext, Peter Brown's Guide system was an
outliner, and the Gopher system was a presented as tree (not in outline
mode) though in fact a web.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The outline browser is quite straightforward. &nbsp;Most
of the
design decisions are around how to represent options to load data, and
whether to load it automatically - many variations are possible.
&nbsp;There are questions as to whether to express links in bother
directions, and whether to suppress links which are reverse versions of
a link displayed at a higher level.</p>

<p>One meme of RDF ethos is that the direction one choses for a
given
property is arbitrary: it doesn't matter whether one defines "parent"
or "child", "employee" or "employer". This philosophy (from the Enquire
design of 1980) is that one should not favor one way over another.
&nbsp;On the other hand, also one should not encourage people
having to
declare both a property and its inverse, which would simply double the
number of definitions out there, and give one more axis of arbitrary
variation in the way information is expressed. Therefore, the design is
to make the system treat forward and backward links
equivalently.&nbsp;
&nbsp;The outliner therefore displays links in both directions. (it
should sort them so obverse and reverse appear together).</p>

<p>The outline is therefore redundant, in that whenever an object
is
expanded more than one deep, for outer link will also be found as a
"dual" inner link in the opposite direction. (e.g. Sam: father Joe: [ is
father of: Sam].) &nbsp;That isn't necessarily a problem. An
interesting operation is "inversion", in which everything which the
outer link is removed, and replaced by its inner dual link, and all the
information which was outside the original link &nbsp;is removed in
favor of its dual inside the inside the dual of the original link. This
is called refocusing in the user manual. It brings the selected branch
to be a new root.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>The code uses the RDF browser written by Jim Ley, without
which the
activation energy for the project would not have been reached at all.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee hacked together the original program in spare time
around the end of 2005.
</p>
<p>Ruth Dhanaraj 
improved the whole program in many ways,
including coding the asynchronous source management module (sources.js),
January-Febrary 2006.
