/* NOTES fps
 * Basiquement, les methodes genre File.list() sur Mac retournent un e accent aigu
 * sous forme, justement, d'un e suivi d'un accent aigu. Cette methode permet
 * de changer cette combinaison de 2 caracteres en un seul.
 * 
 * Il convient donc, sur Mac, de transformer tout nom de fichier tel que retourne
 * par les methodes File.list(), FileDialog, etc par l'utilisation de la methode
 * composeAccents de cette classe. (On n'a pas de probleme pour acceder ensuite
 * au fichier a partir d'une chaine dont les accents sont composes, car
 * le file system du mac s'en accommode.

/**
** An AccentComposer translates from UniCode's combining accent forms into composite characters
** with embedded accents.  This is necessary on Mac OS X and 9, which return the combining accent forms
** as filenames from many places, including File.list() and FileDialog.
**<p>
** The AccentComposer class is both a general-purpose compositer and a Singleton set of default
** composition mappings.  The Singleton is initialized with a set of mappings that covers the typical
** accents one will see in a Roman or Latin-1 situation on Mac OS 9 or X.  It does not cover all possible
** cases for all of UniCode.  However, since you can add additional mappings, or replace the defaults,
** you can easily control how many or which accents will be composited.
**<p>
** The AccentComposer.composeAccents() method is called by the Mac-specific PathnameFormats
** defined in "PathnameFormat.java".  In reality, only Mac OS 9 and X need this, but it's not worth the
** effort to split out Mac OS into pre-9, 9, and X sub-versions.  At least not yet.
**<p>
** Note that there is no AccentDecomposer, and no such capability in this class.
** This is unnecessary for my uses, since the file-system itself happily takes composited characters
** and turns them into combining form.  Good thing, too, because decomposing accented characters
** is more difficult than combining accents and characters together.
**<p>
** Personally, I think it's lame that Java doesn't have a class in "java.text" that performs compositing.
** There's Collator and different ways of comparing accented Strings, but no way to actually translate
** to and fro between the composited and combining forms.
