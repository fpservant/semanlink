semanlink
=========

Semanlink is a personal information management system based on RDF. It lets you add tags, as well as other RDF metadata, to files, bookmarks and text notes. Providing a simple way to organize the tags in	a graph, it allows you to incrementally define the vocabulary you use when annotating documents with metadata.
