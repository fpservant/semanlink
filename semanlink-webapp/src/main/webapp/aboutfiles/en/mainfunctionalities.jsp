<h1>Using Semanlink: main functionalities</h1><div class="graybox"><p>Here are some screenshots showing the most important features of Semanlink.  (Note that there may be small differences with the current version, as these  screenshots date back from the presentation at the Jena User Conference in  May 06)</p><h2>Main page: newest entries</h2><p>Looks very much like the main page of a blog. Each entry has a title, a creationdate, tags, and possibly a text describing it (generally an abstract or a quote).</p><div class="screenshot"><p align="center"><img src="mainfunctionalities_ims/neworupdated.jpg" width="679" height="443"></p></div><h2>Tag</h2><p>One of the views of a tag's page, namely the &quot;Jena&quot; tag. This tag	has several &quot;parents&quot; (&quot;HP&quot;, &quot;Java dev&quot;, &quot;RDF&quot;...),	and also several &quot;children&quot; (&quot;Jena : introduction&quot;, &quot;Jena	rules&quot;, &quot;semblog&quot;). The tree with root &quot;Jena&quot; is shown	here partially opened. (Complete tree of descendants is not loaded when accessing	the tag's page: subtrees are loaded on request using Ajax) On the right side, &quot;linkedtags&quot;: other tags used to mark the documents listed in the page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="screenshot"><p align="center"><img src="mainfunctionalities_ims/tag_jena.jpg" width="679" height="443"></p></div><p>Other views of a tag are available (simple list of the related documents instead	of tree view, so you can sort them by a given property, expanded view of	the	tree, list of images displayed as snapshots,.... ) Here is a view displaying	all	the documents marked with the tag &quot;Arch&eacute;ologie du Niger&quot; (Archeology	in Niger) or any of its descendants. The screen shot also  illustrates		 that	you	can have a quick look at images marked by the tag (loaded	on	request	via	Ajax).</p><div class="screenshot"><p align="center"><img src="mainfunctionalities_ims/tag2.jpg" width="679" height="443"></p></div><h2>Adding a document</h2><p>A &quot;bookmarklet&quot; allows to easily bookmark a web page. Once you confirmed	creation of the bookmark (or of a local copy of the page) you can annotate	it	with metadata. Some metadata has automatically 	been  added,	a	creation	date and a title for instance, but not	only.	If you	had  some	text selected in	the	page when you clicked the bookmarklet, it will be added to a &quot;comment&quot; property.	A basic tag extraction mechanism, that looks for tags in the title and the	comment, proves itself useful. In the example below, this procedure has been	sufficient	to	add three	tags to the document, among which two	actually are correct. Note that the	text &quot;P2P&quot; has automatically	been  replaced by &quot;Peer to peer&quot; (because &quot;P2P&quot;,	in the taxonomy, is defined as an &quot;alias&quot; of the tag &quot;Peer to	peer&quot;). &quot;Philosophie&quot;, which has &quot;Philosophy&quot; as alias,should not	have	been	selected:	just check the	box on	its left	side	and	click &quot;Remove&quot;.</p><div class="screenshot"><p align="center"><img src="mainfunctionalities_ims/newdoc.jpg" width="679" height="459"></p></div><p align="left">At this step, you'll probably want to add more metadata to the	document,	other tags in particular. The &quot;live search&quot; among the tags	is very useful for that purpose. In our example, you may want to add some	tags	related	to &quot;Semantic	Web&quot; - but you don't know exactly which ones.	Type &quot;sem	web&quot; in the search field to get all the tags containing words beginning	with &quot;sem&quot; and &quot;web&quot;. You can	have	a quick look	at	the	descendants	of	any of the tags	in	the	returned	list, and	choose	among	them	which	tag to add to	thedocument.</p><div class="screenshot"><p align="center"><img src="mainfunctionalities_ims/doceditlivesearch.jpg" width="679" height="459"></p></div><h2>Creating and editing a tag</h2><p>Suppose, in the previous	example, that you want to add a new tag with label &quot;Semantic Web P2P&quot; to	the	document. Just type that text in the form area and click add. The new	tag	is	added to the list of tags of the document. You can click it to	get	to	the new tag's page which, in editing mode, displays forms to add	(or	remove)	parents,	children, aliases, and to define some other properties. Again, the live search	proves itself useful in selecting parents (or children) to be added to the	newtag.</p><div class="screenshot"><p align="center"><img src="mainfunctionalities_ims/newtag.jpg" width="679" height="443"></p></div><h2>Searching	for	documents: the graph structure of the set of tags is used.</h2><p>In this example (where display mode is set to &quot;display images&quot;),	searching for tag &quot;Arch&eacute;ologie&quot; (archeology) and &quot;Nigeria&quot; returnsdocuments with none of these tags: only descendants of them.</p><div class="screenshot"><p align="center"><img src="mainfunctionalities_ims/and.jpg" width="679" height="443"></p></div></div>
