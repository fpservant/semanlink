<h1>Getting started</h1><div class="graybox">
	<p>This document helps you in your first steps using Semanlink. It supposes that you have installed
	the application on your computer. (How to install the application is described in the READ-ME
	file included at the root of the distribution zip file).</p>	<p>Once you have installed the bookmarklet, you can easily created your first	  bookmark in Semanlink (if you haven't installed the bookmarklet yet, click	  &quot;Home&quot; in the top menu-bar to go back to &quot;Home page&quot; and	  do it now).</p>	<h2>Creating your first bookmark with Semanlink</h2>	<ul>	  <li><strong>Go to a page you want to bookmark</strong> (it would be a good	    idea to open it in another tab or window to be able to easily flip between	    it and this    tutorial). Better also (for the purpose of the demo), to choose a page on	    the web (not an HTML file on your disk). For this tutorial, we'll use	    the <a href="http://www.semanlink.net">Semanlink Home Page</a>.</li>      <li>Optionally <strong>select some text</strong> you would like to        store along with your bookmark.</li>	  <li><strong>Click the bookmarklet</strong>. This brings you to the &quot;New	    Bookmark&quot; form,	    which is predocumented with the URL of the page and its title. If you	    selected some text in the page, it is copied in the &quot;comment&quot; field	    of the form.Make    any modification you may want.If, for any reason, you want to go back to	    the page, click the &quot;URI's document&quot; hyperlink (and then the bookmarklet	    again). Don't look at this time for a way to add tags, you'll do that	    later.</li>    </ul>	<div class="screenshot"><p align="center"><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/2.jpg" width="797" height="463"></p></div>	<ul>	<li>At this point, decide <strong>to make a bookmark, to save a copy			of the page to your disk, or to do both</strong>. (You don't have the possibility	  to	save a copy if you opened an HTML file located on your disk). If	  you	choose &quot;Bookmark			and save a copy&quot;,			the main resource (the one that gets listed in search results) is			the	online page, while it	is the file	saved	to disk	if	you	choose &quot;Save			a copy, keeping track of source&quot;.<strong> </strong>Click one of the four			buttons, for instance &quot;Bookmark and save a copy&quot;.<br>	  This brings you to a page modelizing the bookmark (or file) you just saved,	  in a way that is ready for editing (that is, adding metadata): several form	  fields are displayed. (If you look at the right bar, you'll see	that the &quot;EDIT...&quot; panel	  is opened).	</li>	</ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/3.jpg"></p></div>	<ul>	<li>In normal use,we would continue editing now, but let's have a stop before	  going on: <strong>click the &quot;EDIT...&quot; button in the right bar (to	  turn editing off)</strong>, and let's look at what we've got so far. A bookmark	  has been created and saved to disk. The currently displayed page shows	  information about it:	  some metadata has been added to the bookmark (in particular, a title, a	  comment and a creation date):	  <ul>      </ul>	</li>	</ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/4.jpg"></p></div>	<ul>	<li>Let's play a little bit with this page:	  <ul>	    <li><strong>Click the title</strong>: the bookmarked page	        is displayed. <strong>From there, click the bookmarklet</strong>: you're	        back on the bookmark page in Semanlink</li>        <li>Click the &quot;<strong>New Entries</strong>&quot; button in the          top menu-bar: the bookmark is listed, with its comment. Click the link:          the bookmarked		        page	    gets displayed.(Click the bookmarklet again to get back to the bookmark          in Semanlink).</li>        <li>If you also saved a copy of the page (using the &quot;Bookmark and          save a copy&quot; button on the &quot;New Bookmark&quot; form), there's          an hyperlink entitled &quot;Local copy&quot; (near the bottom of the          page) that you can click to display the copy. (If you used &quot;Save          a copy keeping track of source&quot;, things are different: you can          click the hyperlink &quot;source&quot; to display the original page)</li>	  </ul>	</li>    <li>We'll now add tags to this bookmark.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Tags</h2>  <h3>Adding tags to the bookmark we've created</h3><ul>  <li>Display the bookmark page and switch to editing mode if necessary (button    in the right bar). Locate the tags form, type a tag to be added, for instance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      "RDF",and click the &quot;Add&quot; button:</li></ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/6.jpg" width="580" height="70"></p></div><ul>  <li>    Let's add some more tags. A tag may contain several words, and  accented      characters:</li></ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/7.jpg" width="581" height="70"></p></div><ul>  <li>  	Let's turn editing  off (button in the right bar) to see the result:</li></ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/80.jpg" width="795" height="287"></p></div><ul>  <li>  	There's an alternative way to add tags to a bookmark, using the search form  	  in the right bar. You'll use this second way when the  	  number of tags  	  will become larger in your collection.</li></ul><h3>Each tag has its page, and its URI</h3><ul>  <li>  	Let's click the tag &quot;RDF&quot; in the list of tags of the bookmark. A  	page dedicated to the tag gets displayed. (Its URL is &quot;[host:port]/semanlink/tag/rdf&quot;).  	  The bookmark we've just created is listed (alone, of course). You may be  	curious about the words &quot;parents&quot; and &quot;children&quot; that  	you can notice on the page. We'll see right now what they are about.</li></ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/90tag.jpg" width="795" height="287"></p></div><h3>A graph of tags</h3><ul>  <li>    Semanlink lets you organize your tags in <strong>a simple, oriented, graph</strong> of    tags. A &quot;<strong>child</strong>&quot; of a tag is a tag that is more specific    than its &quot;<strong>parent</strong>&quot; tag.  	    To state, for instance, that &quot;RDF&quot; is a subtopic of &quot;Semantic  	    Web&quot;, we can add a parent tag &quot;Semantic Web&quot; to the tag  	    &quot;RDF&quot;. Turn editing on and use the &quot;Parents&quot; form  	    to do that: type &quot;Semantic  	    Web&quot; in the form field, and  	    click &quot;Add Parent&quot;. Of course, a tag can have several parents  	    (note that, as a human beeing, we generally have two; files in old-fashioned  	    OS     only have one). Add another parent to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      &quot;RDF&quot;,   for instance &quot;W3C&quot;:</li></ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/100tagedit.jpg" width="796" height="205"></p></div><ul>  <li>  	Turn editing off and click &quot;Semantic Web&quot;, to display the corresponding page:</li></ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/110.jpg" width="794" height="238"></p></div><ul>  <li>  	Click the triangle on the left of &quot;RDF&quot;:</li></ul><div class="screenshot"><p><img src="getting_started_tutorial_ims/120.jpg" width="796" height="287"></p></div><h3><a name="tagcloud"></a>Tag cloud</h3><ul>  <li>  	Look at the &quot;<strong>Tag Cloud</strong>&quot; in the right bar.

In our case now, this  	  list contains of course one and only one item: our bookmark.  	  &quot;Personal  	  information management&quot; and &quot;Tagging&quot; are  	  listed in the tag cloud because they have been  	  used to tag our bookmark.  	  Though RDF has also been used to tag it, it is not in the tag  	  cloud, because  	  it  	  is a  	  descendant  	  of Semantic Web.
