%>Semanlink is a <strong>personal knowledge graph management system</strong> based on <strong>RDF</strong>. It	lets you add <strong>tags</strong>, as well as other RDF metadata,	to bookmarks, files	and short text notes. 	Providing a simple way to <strong>organize the	tags	in	a	graph</strong>, it allows you	to incrementally define the vocabulary you use when annotating documentswith metadata.
