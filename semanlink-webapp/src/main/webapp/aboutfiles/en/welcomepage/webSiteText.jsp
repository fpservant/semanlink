            <p>
            As a demo, you'll find my bookmarks on this site. 
            Click the "News" button at   the top of  this    page to see the latest bookmarks that I added, 
            in a page that looks a bit like the main page of a blog.    Each bookmark has a creation    date,   tags, 
            and often a short   description (generally  an  abstract or a   quote).
