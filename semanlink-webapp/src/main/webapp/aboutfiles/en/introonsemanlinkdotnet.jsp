<!--docs/about/intro.htm--><p>Semanlink is a <strong>personal knowledge graph management system</strong> based on <strong>RDF</strong>. It	lets you add <strong>tags</strong>, as well as other RDF metadata,	to files, bookmarks	and short text notes that it allows to write. 	Providing a simple way to <strong>organize the	tags	in	a	graph</strong>, it allows you	to incrementally define the vocabulary you use when annotating documentswith metadata.</p><h2>News</h2><h3>Semanlink at the Jena User Conference.</h3><p>Semanlink, which is built with Jena,	has	been	presented at the Jena User Conference, organized by HP Labs (May	10th and	11th	2006,	Bristol,	UK).	Here	is the <a href="http://www.semanlink.net/files/2006/02/jena_semanlink_paper.htm">presentation	paper</a>. Thanks to the	Jena	team	for	a very interesting	and	enjoyable event.</p><p>Feedback about Semanlink has been positive.</p><p>One thing I should have said but I didn't: you can integrate Semanlink data	into HTML pages served by your web application using Ajax (both	Semanlink	and your web application must be servedby the same host, however). Here is a <a href="http://www.semanlink.net/docs/about/ajax-sl.htm">demo</a>.</p><h3>A downloadable version of Semanlink will be released really soon now.</h3><p>(An infortunate event - the death of my computer - made it impossible for  me to achieve that on June 15th, as previously announced).</p><h2>Demo</h2><p>As a <strong>demo</strong>, you'll find on this site a subset of my personal	documentation (files and bookmarks I am interested with). Clicking  the &quot;New	Entries&quot; button	at	the	top	of	this	page	will show you the latest	entries that I added, in a page that looks a bit like the main page of a	blog.	Each	entry has a	creation	date,	tags,	and often a short	description	(generally	an	abstract	or	a	quote).</p><p>Access	in this demo is	limited	to	bookmarks	(links	to			documents	lead	to	a	restricted area protected by a password,		as they are often copyrighted).</p><h2>Presentation</h2><p>A  <a href="http://www.semanlink.net/files/2006/02/jena_semanlink_paper.htm">presentation		paper</a> describes the day to day use of Semanlink, in particular	how you create new entries and how you mark them with metadata (what you	won't be able to see in the demo which only shows consultation, not editing).	Here is a brief introduction:</p><h3>A personal information management system</h3><p>Semanlink lets add RDF metadata to files, bookmarks		and short text notes that it allows to write,	organize and	display.</p><h3>A tagging utility</h3><p>Basically, it is a tagging utility: you use it to add tags to your documents.</p><h3>A tool to build thesauri as graphs of tags</h3><p>But Semanlink	also provides	 a	simple	way	to	organize	your		tags	in a	graph:	each tag may have several &quot;parents&quot; and &quot;children&quot;,	as well as other RDF properties.	Tagging	the tags allows	you	to	incrementally		define the vocabulary you use to annotate documents. This way,		you model	your	own representation of concepts and their relations.		Semanlink provides a GUI to easily navigate through the graph of tags.		And	of course, the taxonomy you build is used when searching: for instance,		a	document	taggedwith &quot;RDF&quot; will be found when searching for &quot;Semantic Web&quot;.</p><h3>A	file based RDF store</h3><p>By default, metadata about  files is stored in small RDF files, that	are	saved	in the same directory as the files they describe (or in a parent	directory). This is an important feature, not only because no database is	needed	to run	Semanlink:	for instance, when you save a copy of one directory to a CD or when you move	it to another location, metadata about its files is also copied or moved,	and ready to be used without any modification, as relative URLs are used	to	identify	the	files.</p><p>Metadata about bookmarks, as well as the short notes created within the application,	are	stored	in a directory organized with a &quot;year/month&quot; structure.</p><p>The definition of tags is written separately from the metadata about files:	a vocabulary can therefore easily be reused in another context. Several graphs	of	tags,	each with its own URI, can be used to mark a set of documents.</p><p>All	these RDF files are loaded into memory at startup.</p><h3>Comparing Semanlink with other information management systems</h3><p>To tagging systems, Semanlink adds an organization of tags' space that they	generally lack, and which is the	basis	for &quot;concept	navigation&quot; among	tags and documents.</p><p>Like hierarchical file systems, Semanlink makes extensive use of tree traversal.	But it adds to these hierarchies the possibility to store each document	in	several &quot;directories&quot; at	the same time (aliases or shortcuts, by the way, are not sufficient: given a	file, you cannot know to which directories its shortcuts belong to). While pathnames	are used to store metadata about files, system-level addressing and classification	data	are	cleanly	separated in Semanlink.</p><p>Like ontologies, Semanlink taxonomies are graph based. But keeping things	simple, it allows for dynamic growth and frequent modification	of	hierarchies.</p><h3>Semanlink is based on	Jena</h3><p>Semanlink runs as a servlet and has been developed with <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/index.html">Jena</a>. It uses plain	vanilla RDF memory models, which give very fast response time for any operation,	at least on my models (more than 20,000 statements about 3000 documents and	involving 2000 tags, as of this writing).</p><h2>Contact</h2><p>I am Fran&ccedil;ois-Paul Servant.
