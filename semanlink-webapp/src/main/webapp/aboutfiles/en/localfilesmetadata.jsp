<h1>Adding metadata to files on your disk</h1><div class="graybox"><p>Two problems arise when it's about adding metadata to local files and using  them within a web application such as Semanlink:</p><ol>  <li>local files do not have &quot;cool URIs&quot; - we frequently      want to change their location or their filename  </li>  <li>file URIs cannot be used, as browsers generally don't let you access      a file from an HTML page, unless it is itself a page read directly from    the disk (that is to say, with an URl such as file:///). But pages generated      by Semanlink are accessed with an http URL. Clicking on an HTML link connecting    to a file-protocol page won't work (even if the servlet is running on localhost)</li></ol><h2>Local files do not have &quot;cool URIs&quot;</h2><p>The answer to the first question is storing the metadata about a file near  the file, in an rdf file (called &quot;sl.rdf&quot;) which, typically, is located  in the same directory, and that uses relative URIs. This doesn't let you change  the short name of the file marked with the metadata, but if you move or copy  the directory  to another place, the metadata remains valid.</p><p>When the semanlink servlet starts, it has to load all the &quot;sl.rdf&quot; files  on your disk. But scanning all your hard drive, looking for such files would  be too long : you have to declare, in the semanlink-configuration.xml file,  where to look for these metadata files (this is done through the  declaration of &quot;DataFolders&quot;, see <a href="config.htm">semanlink-configuration</a>)</p><h2>HTTP URIs for files</h2><p>As it is not possible to link to a file-protocol URL from an HTML page served  by a servlet, Semanlink has to give HTTP URLs to local files that are to  be tagged with metadata.</p><p>Semanlink can provide access to any file on your disk, with an URL starting  with [semanlinkURL]/document For security reasons, only files inside  directories declared in the &quot;[semanlinkDataDir]/conf/semanlink-config.xml&quot; file  can be served this way.</p><p>By default, one such DataFolder is declared in the semanlink-config.xml file.  It is the directory located at &quot;[semanlinkDataDir]/documents&quot;.  A file  such  as  &quot;[semanlinkDataDir]/documents/2006/11/file.htm&quot;  is served at URL &quot;[semanlinkURL/document/2006/11/file.htm&quot;</p><p>If you want to serve files from another directory, for instance from &quot;C:\foodir&quot;,  open the &quot;semanlink-configuration.xml&quot; file and add a slc:dataFolder property  to the sl:SLModel defined in the following way:</p><pre><code>		&lt;slc:dataFolder&gt;<br>			&lt;sl:DataFolder rdf:about=&quot;document/foo&quot;&gt;<br>				&lt;slc:filePath&gt;C:\foodir&lt;/slc:filePath&gt;<br>			&lt;/sl:DataFolder&gt;<br>		&lt;/slc:dataFolder&gt;</code></pre><p>A file &quot;C:\foodir\file.htm&quot; will be served at URL &quot;[semanlinkURL]/document/foo/file.htm&quot;</p><p>See <a href="config.htm">semanlink-configuration</a> for more information.</p><p>Note: If you open &quot;C:\foodir\file.htm&quot; by double-clicking it, you  will open &quot;file:///C|/foo/file.htm&quot; in your browser. Clicking the bookmarklet  will return  the  metadata  about  &quot;[semanlinkURL]/document/foo/file.htm&quot; (This means that if you have  accessed to a file in a &quot;traditional way&quot;, using the OS, you can nevertheless  easily get the metadata about it).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
